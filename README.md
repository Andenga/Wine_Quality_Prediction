<h1>DATASET</h1>
<p>This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.It describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality.</p>

<em>“Life is too short to drink bad wine.”</em>

<p>I have used various machine learning classificaton algorithms to predict the quality of the wine. Each wine is given a quality score of between 0 and 10. For the purpose of the project I coverted this binary score to good and bad</p>
<p>The Dataset can be found on <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset">Kaggle</a></p>
<p>The contents of the columns in the dataset are: </p>
<p><em><b>Fixed acidity.</b></em> The predominant fixed acids in wine, such as tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic acids.<br>
<em><b>Volatile acidity.</b></em> The high acetic acid present in wine, which causes an unpleasant vinegar taste.<br>
<em><b>Citric acid.</b></em> A weak organic acid used to increase the freshness and flavor of wine.<br>
<em><b>Residual sugar.</b></em> The amount of sugar left after fermentation.<br>
<em><b>Chlorides.</b></em> The amount of salt in wine. The lower chloride rate creates better quality wines.<br>
<em><b>Free sulfur dioxide.</b></em> SO2 is used for preventing wine from oxidation and microbial spoilage.<br>
<em><b>Total sulfur dioxide.</b></em> The amount of free and bound forms of SO2.<br>
<em><b>Density.</b></em> Depends on the alcohol and sugar content. Better wines usually have lower densities.<br>
<em><b>pH.</b></em> Used to check the level of acidity or alkalinity of wine.<br>
<em><b>Sulfates.</b></em> An antibacterial and antioxidant agent added to wine.<br>
<em><b>Alcohol.</b></em> The percentage of alcohol in wine. A higher concentration leads to better quality.<br></p>

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>From my prediction, Random Forest gave the highest accuracy score. Hence it is the best model to use.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the wine quality prediction scores can be significantly improved by increasing the amount of fixed acidity, citric acid, sulfates, and alcohol, as well as decreasing the amount of volatile acidity and chlorides.</p>
